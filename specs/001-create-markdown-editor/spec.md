# Feature Specification: Markdown Editor MVP

**Feature Branch**: `001-create-markdown-editor`
**Created**: 2025-10-31
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Create a markdown editor MVP with real-time preview, basic formatting, and file operations. Built with Shadcn/Vite and featuring GitHub-style live markdown visualization. Hosted on GitHub Pages."
**Tech Context**: Vite + React 18 SPA with Shadcn/ui components, GitHub-style markdown rendering, deployed to GitHub Pages

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

<!--
  IMPORTANT: User stories should be PRIORITIZED as user journeys ordered by importance.
  Each user story/journey must be INDEPENDENTLY TESTABLE - meaning if you implement just ONE of them,
  you should still have a viable MVP (Minimum Viable Product) that delivers value.
  
  Assign priorities (P1, P2, P3, etc.) to each story, where P1 is the most critical.
  Think of each story as a standalone slice of functionality that can be:
  - Developed independently
  - Tested independently
  - Deployed independently
  - Demonstrated to users independently
-->

### User Story 1 - Edit Markdown with GitHub-Style Live Preview (Priority: P1)

A user opens the editor and begins writing or editing markdown content. The interface features a split-view layout inspired by GitHub: markdown editor on the left with syntax highlighting, and a live HTML preview on the right that renders exactly as it would appear on GitHub. As they type, the preview updates in real-time, providing immediate visual feedback.

**Why this priority**: This is the core MVP functionality. Without the ability to edit and preview markdown with GitHub-style rendering, the application has no value. It's the primary user journey and defines the user experience.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by opening the editor, typing markdown content (headers, bold, italic, links, code blocks), and verifying the preview panel shows correct GitHub-style HTML rendering. Delivers the essential editor experience with familiar GitHub rendering.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the editor is open with an empty document, **When** a user types "# Hello World", **Then** the preview pane displays an H1 heading styled with GitHub's typography
2. **Given** markdown content with multiple formatting elements, **When** the user types changes, **Then** the preview updates within 500ms with GitHub-accurate rendering
3. **Given** content with code blocks using backticks, **When** the user edits content, **Then** the preview renders code blocks with GitHub-style syntax highlighting
4. **Given** a user pastes markdown content (including GitHub flavored markdown like tables/checkboxes), **When** the paste completes, **Then** the preview immediately reflects the content with accurate GitHub rendering
5. **Given** the editor displays content, **When** examining the preview styling, **Then** it matches GitHub's default markdown rendering style (fonts, colors, spacing)

### User Story 2 - Format Text with Shadcn Toolbar Buttons (Priority: P2)

A user wants to quickly format text without typing markdown syntax. They select text and click formatting buttons (bold, italic, headers, etc.) in the toolbar (built with Shadcn components), which automatically inserts or wraps the selected text with appropriate markdown syntax. The toolbar maintains a clean, modern aesthetic consistent with Shadcn design patterns.

**Why this priority**: This dramatically improves usability for non-technical users and speeds up content creation. It's valuable for MVP but not required for basic functionality (users can type markdown directly). Shadcn components ensure consistent, professional UX.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by selecting text, clicking format buttons in the Shadcn toolbar, and verifying correct markdown syntax is applied and preview updates with GitHub-style rendering.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** text is selected in the editor, **When** the bold Shadcn button is clicked, **Then** the selected text is wrapped with ** markers and preview shows bold text with GitHub styling
2. **Given** text is selected, **When** the H1 Shadcn button is clicked, **Then** "# " is added to the beginning of the line and preview shows H1 heading with GitHub typography
3. **Given** the cursor is in an empty paragraph, **When** the bullet list Shadcn button is clicked, **Then** "- " is inserted and preview shows a list item formatted like GitHub
4. **Given** the editor has content, **When** the link Shadcn button is clicked with selected text, **Then** a markdown link [text](url) format is applied and preview shows GitHub-styled link
5. **Given** the Shadcn toolbar is visible, **When** examining its appearance, **Then** it displays modern Shadcn styling consistent with the overall application design

---

### User Story 3 - Save and Load Markdown Files (Priority: P3)

A user can save their markdown content to a file on their computer and load previously saved files. They use browser file operations (download/upload) to persist their work and return to it later.

**Why this priority**: Essential for real usage but can be achieved with basic browser APIs (download/upload). The editor is still useful without this if content is temporary, but persistence adds significant value for regular users.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by creating content, downloading it, clearing the editor, and uploading the file to verify content is restored.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the editor has markdown content, **When** the user clicks "Download", **Then** a .md file is downloaded with the content and correct filename
2. **Given** a previously downloaded markdown file exists, **When** the user clicks "Upload" and selects the file, **Then** the content loads into the editor and preview updates
3. **Given** the editor has unsaved changes, **When** the user downloads the file, **Then** all current changes are included in the downloaded file
4. **Given** an empty editor, **When** a file is uploaded, **Then** the editor displays the file content and filename is shown

### Edge Cases

- What happens when a user pastes extremely large content (>1MB)? Preview should remain responsive.
- How does the system handle malformed markdown (unclosed code blocks, mismatched syntax)? Should render best-effort without crashing.
- What happens when a user rapidly deletes and types content? Preview must stay synchronized.
- How does the system handle special characters and unicode in markdown? Should preserve and render correctly.
- What happens if file upload fails or is interrupted? Should show appropriate error message.
- How does the system handle very long lines (>1000 characters)? Should not break layout.

- Content is stored only in browser memory during session (no persistence between sessions without explicit save)
- Shadcn/ui components are available and properly configured in Vite project for consistent UI implementation
- GitHub-style markdown rendering is achieved through appropriate markdown-to-HTML library with GitHub-compatible CSS styling
- Application will be built with Vite as the build tool and bundler (following https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/installation/vite)
- Application will be deployed to GitHub Pages via GitHub Actions or manual deployment
- GitHub Pages serves the static SPA from repository (either main branch root or /docs or gh-pages branch)
