# Feature Specification: Markdown Editor MVP

**Feature Branch**: `001-create-markdown-editor`
**Created**: 2025-10-31
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Create a markdown editor MVP with real-time preview, basic formatting, and file operations"

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

<!--
  IMPORTANT: User stories should be PRIORITIZED as user journeys ordered by importance.
  Each user story/journey must be INDEPENDENTLY TESTABLE - meaning if you implement just ONE of them,
  you should still have a viable MVP (Minimum Viable Product) that delivers value.
  
  Assign priorities (P1, P2, P3, etc.) to each story, where P1 is the most critical.
  Think of each story as a standalone slice of functionality that can be:
  - Developed independently
  - Tested independently
  - Deployed independently
  - Demonstrated to users independently
-->

### User Story 1 - Edit Markdown with Real-Time Preview (Priority: P1)

A user opens the editor and begins writing or editing markdown content. As they type, they see the rendered HTML preview update in real-time on the side of the screen. This gives them immediate visual feedback on how their markdown will appear when published.

**Why this priority**: This is the core MVP functionality. Without the ability to edit and preview markdown, the application has no value. It's the primary user journey.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by opening the editor, typing markdown content (headers, bold, italic, links), and verifying the preview panel shows correct HTML rendering. Delivers the essential editor experience.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the editor is open with an empty document, **When** a user types "# Hello World", **Then** the preview pane displays an H1 heading with "Hello World"
2. **Given** markdown content with multiple formatting elements, **When** the user types changes, **Then** the preview updates within 500ms
3. **Given** content with special characters and code blocks, **When** the user edits content, **Then** the preview correctly renders code blocks with syntax preservation
4. **Given** a user pastes markdown content, **When** the paste completes, **Then** the preview immediately reflects the pasted content

### User Story 2 - Format Text with Toolbar Buttons (Priority: P2)

A user wants to quickly format text without typing markdown syntax. They select text and click formatting buttons (bold, italic, headers, etc.) in the toolbar, which automatically inserts or wraps the selected text with appropriate markdown syntax.

**Why this priority**: This dramatically improves usability for non-technical users and speeds up content creation. It's valuable for MVP but not required for basic functionality (users can type markdown directly).

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by selecting text, clicking format buttons, and verifying correct markdown syntax is applied and preview updates.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** text is selected in the editor, **When** the bold button is clicked, **Then** the selected text is wrapped with ** markers and preview shows bold text
2. **Given** text is selected, **When** the H1 button is clicked, **Then** "# " is added to the beginning of the line and preview shows H1 heading
3. **Given** the cursor is in an empty paragraph, **When** the bullet list button is clicked, **Then** "- " is inserted and preview shows a list item
4. **Given** the editor has content, **When** the link button is clicked with selected text, **Then** a markdown link [text](url) format is applied

---

### User Story 3 - Save and Load Markdown Files (Priority: P3)

A user can save their markdown content to a file on their computer and load previously saved files. They use browser file operations (download/upload) to persist their work and return to it later.

**Why this priority**: Essential for real usage but can be achieved with basic browser APIs (download/upload). The editor is still useful without this if content is temporary, but persistence adds significant value for regular users.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by creating content, downloading it, clearing the editor, and uploading the file to verify content is restored.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the editor has markdown content, **When** the user clicks "Download", **Then** a .md file is downloaded with the content and correct filename
2. **Given** a previously downloaded markdown file exists, **When** the user clicks "Upload" and selects the file, **Then** the content loads into the editor and preview updates
3. **Given** the editor has unsaved changes, **When** the user downloads the file, **Then** all current changes are included in the downloaded file
4. **Given** an empty editor, **When** a file is uploaded, **Then** the editor displays the file content and filename is shown

### Edge Cases

- What happens when a user pastes extremely large content (>1MB)? Preview should remain responsive.
- How does the system handle malformed markdown (unclosed code blocks, mismatched syntax)? Should render best-effort without crashing.
- What happens when a user rapidly deletes and types content? Preview must stay synchronized.
- How does the system handle special characters and unicode in markdown? Should preserve and render correctly.
- What happens if file upload fails or is interrupted? Should show appropriate error message.
- How does the system handle very long lines (>1000 characters)? Should not break layout.

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: The content in this section represents placeholders.
  Fill them out with the right functional requirements.
-->

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST provide a split-view editor interface with markdown input on the left and live HTML preview on the right
- **FR-002**: System MUST update the preview pane in real-time as users type (within 500ms of last keystroke)
- **FR-003**: System MUST support standard markdown syntax including headers, bold, italic, links, lists, code blocks, and blockquotes
- **FR-004**: System MUST provide a toolbar with buttons for basic formatting (Bold, Italic, Header, Bullet List, Link, Code)
- **FR-005**: System MUST allow users to download their markdown content as a .md file with a user-specified filename
- **FR-006**: System MUST allow users to upload and load .md files from their computer into the editor
- **FR-007**: System MUST display clear error messages when file operations fail (invalid file format, read errors, etc.)
- **FR-008**: System MUST handle markdown content up to 1MB without performance degradation
- **FR-009**: Users MUST be able to clear the editor and start with a blank document
- **FR-010**: System MUST preserve all markdown content during edit, preview, and file operations with no data loss

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*

- **Document**: Represents the markdown file being edited. Contains the raw markdown text content and metadata (filename, creation timestamp)
- **FormattingAction**: Represents a toolbar action that applies markdown syntax. Attributes: button type (bold, italic, header, etc.), markdown pattern to apply, selection handling

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: Define measurable success criteria.
  These must be technology-agnostic and measurable.
-->

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: Users can write and preview markdown content with preview updating within 500ms of typing
- **SC-002**: System correctly renders all supported markdown syntax elements (headers, bold, italic, lists, links, code blocks)
- **SC-003**: File download completes successfully with correct filename and all content preserved
- **SC-004**: File upload loads markdown content into editor accurately with no data corruption
- **SC-005**: Editor remains responsive and usable when handling documents up to 1MB in size
- **SC-006**: Formatting toolbar buttons correctly apply markdown syntax to selected text and update preview
- **SC-007**: 100% of acceptance scenarios in User Stories pass without errors or data loss
- **SC-008**: Editor provides clear, actionable error messages for all failure scenarios (invalid files, corrupt content, etc.)

## Assumptions

- Users have modern web browsers with JavaScript support and File API capabilities
- Markdown syntax support follows CommonMark specification basics (users expect standard markdown)
- File operations use browser's native download/upload (no backend file storage required for MVP)
- Content is stored only in browser memory during session (no persistence between sessions without explicit save)
